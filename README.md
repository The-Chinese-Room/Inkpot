# Inkpot
**Inkpot** - A container for **Ink** within the Unreal Engine developed by [The Chinese Room](https://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/).<br><br>
This is a plugin for Unreal Engine 5.4 or later.<br>
This is version **1.11.21** of the plugin.</br>
The head revision contains work in progress towards the upcoming release.<br>

Inkpot is a wrapper for the wonderful narrative scripting language **Ink** developed by [Inkle Studios](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).<br>

For a demo of how this integrates with an Unreal project (& a load more documentation) see [the inkpot demo](https://github.com/The-Chinese-Room/InkpotDemo/).<br>

## Requirements 
Inkpot works with version 5.4 of Unreal.<br>
Inkpot includes a C++ port of Ink-engine-runtime version 21, which can be found in the InkPlusPlus module.<br>

### .Net framework 5.0
InkleCate requires the .net framework 5.0 which you can download from here.<br>
https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-5.0.17-windows-x64-installer<br>
(Without this you will not be able to import Ink source)<br>

### Visual Studio 2022
This plugin is distributed as source code which needs compiling.<br>
You will need to install Visual Studio 2022.<br>
https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/<br>

## Installing the plugin

Make sure you have **.Net framework 5.0** and **Visual Studio 2022** installed.<br>

In your **project folder**, create a folder named **Plugins** and copy the Inkpot plugin there.<br>
Make sure the inkpot folder is called simply '**Inkpot**'.<br>

LIke this:<br>

    [Project Root Directory]/Plugins/Inkpot/

For an example of how this plugin should sit in your project see the InkpotDemo.<br>

## FAQ

### I cannot compile the plugin.
* Inkpot is distributed as C++ source code and will need compiling. <br>
Make sure you have **Visual Studio 2022** installed.<br>

* If you get this error _VisualStudioUnsupported x64 must be installed in order to build this target_.<br> 
For Unreal Engine 5.4, you need to be on v17.8 of the MSCV v143 toolchain. See here for more details.<br>
https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/visualstudiounsupported-x64-must-be-installed-trying-to-update-a-project-from-5-3-2-to-5-4-1/1835116/5

### My Ink files will not import.

* Make sure you have **.Net framework 5.0** installed.<br>
Inkpot uses Inklecate to compile the Ink files and it needs .net 5.0.<br>
Without this the Ink files will not import.<br>

* Inkpot has only been tested as an application plugin and not an engine plugin.<br>
It needs to be located in the project's plugins folder and not the engine plugin folder.<br>

* The plugin folder name should be simply 'inkpot',<br>
If you unzipped it directly to your project, it will likely be called 'inkpot-release'.<br>
eg <your project root>\plugins\inkpot<br>

* See the inkpotdemo for how it should look in your project.<br>
https://github.com/The-Chinese-Room/InkpotDemo<br>


### My Ink file changes will not update on reimport.
* Inky, the Ink script editor, will silently fail when saving to read only files.<br>
Some version control systems will make the file read only when you check them out, eg perforce.<br>
This can lead to some confusion when running Inky alongside Unreal & Inkpot.<br>


## Module Structure
Inkpot is made from three modules. <br>

### InkPlusPlus
InkPlusPlus is the name of the module that contains the C++ port of the Ink Engine Runtime which can be found here</br>
https://github.com/inkle/ink/tree/master/ink-engine-runtime

When porting the code from C# to C++ we came to the conclusion that we should keep the source as close to the original C# as possible to make updates easier. </br>
This has now been updated to Inkversion 21, Ink v1.1.1. </br>

### Inkpot 
A set of wrapper classes for InkPlusPlus to simplify Blueprint coding.<br>
Manages the lifetime of the Ink story and provides the interface for Ink variable setting, getting and change notification.<br>

### InkpotEditor 
This is the unreal editor facing part of Ink pot.</br>
This manages the defintion of data types in Unreal for inkpot and the compilation of new Ink scripts as they are added to the project.</br>
It also contains the unit tests for InkPlusPlus.</br>

## Other folders
There area couple of supporting folders that make up the Inkpot distribution.<br>

### TestInkSource
All the Unit tests for Ink.</br> 
Currently 180 tests.

### Third Party 
This contains a copy of InkleCate and is used by the script importer to compile the scripts.<br>

## Thanks to 
**[Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/)** </br>
for creating Ink. We've used this for much more than narrative.</br></br>
**[UnrealInk](https://github.com/DavidColson/UnrealInk)**</br>
for giving us a good basis for creating InkPlusPlus.</br></br>
**Colin, Seb & Canute at TCR**</br>
for the brilliant job in porting the Ink Engine Runtime to C++, along with the editor asset handling, unit tests and Unreal integration, most of the work here in fact.<br>
